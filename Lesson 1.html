                <article>
                    <p> How do I start Website development? What are the things I need to do? Are you also unsure about how you can start
                        off with learning web development and become in pro in the coming months?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the video, I'll guide you through how you can achieve a pro level in web development from my own past experince as 
                        a focal point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first step is understanding your preference. What do you wanna do? Do you wanna design or you wanna code? 
                        If you wanna design, then you will be looking at tools like Shopify, WordPress, Squarespace and Wix. But if you wanna code 
                        then you have to start with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I made a video on programing languages roadmaps to follow, make sure
                        you watch that..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step 2, get the right resources. Resources to learn Website design are vast and they vary from online forums to YouTube
                        videos to paid Udemy,Coursera and others. Visit this platforms and find a video/course that you resonate with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step 3, Start building. With the right resources which you've found in the previous step, you can start building. Pick a small 
                        project and build. That's the best way to practice what you've learnt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step 4, Take on real projects. Now that you've done all this it's time to take on real jobs.
                        Apply for jobs and deliver them. The more jobs you do, the better you become.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also made a video on specs to look out for before purchasing a laptop, so make sure you are certain that you have 
                        the right work tools to begin your web development journey with.
                    </p>
